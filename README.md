================

Monster/Dungeon/Encounter/Campaign/Whatever generator/crowd based for Dungeons and Dragons 5E


A Type is something an attribute that defines another element(creatures, locations, traps, dungeons...), such as flying, aquatic, goblinoid, huge, regenerative and anything else.
A creature is generated by getting random traits and calculation the correct numbers.
An encounter is a bunch of creatures who share a common trait and fill a Challenge Rating, a encounter can also be based in a location.
A trap is something that is found in dungeons and eats tasty adventurers.
A dungeon is a location that holds encounters, doors, puzzles and traps.
A campaign is a bunch of dungeons, encounters and locations sew together under the pretense of "plot". Plot is deprecated in dnd, and combat is current solution.

I don't really have any idea how to hold all this together, I think I should stick with generating monsters and then growing.
